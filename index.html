      <h2>Problems RWD solves</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the problems that responsive web design addresses is the changing of browser window inconsistencies, such as changing window size, font settings, color settings. Responsive web design changed this with changing font settings into pixels, to be able to adapt. Another problem RWD fixes is the changing ways that web sites are viewed, changing from just computers to phones, tablets, game consoles, projecter screens. RWD makes it so that websites can respond to be viewed on all of these devices with the same level of efficiency as the developer saw on their screen.
